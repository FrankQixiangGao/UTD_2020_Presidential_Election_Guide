         <body>The Voter Registration deadline in Texas is October 5th
            
            <span style="color:#c75b12;font-family:Georgia,serif">(Disclaimer: The day to register for the upcoming 2020 elections on November 3rd have passed)</span>
            <br>so it’s important you make sure you’re registered.
            <br><br>
            There are three main ways you can register: 
	<ul>
            <li>Contact or visit your local voter registrar to complete an application in person. </li>
	<ul>
            <li>The Dallas County Elections Office is found at 1520 Round Table Drive Dallas 75247.</li>
            <li>The Collin County Elections office is found at  2010 Redbud Blvd., Suite 102 McKinney 75069.</li>
            <li>Find your Local Voter Registrar Office here: <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/votregduties.shtml" class="link">County Voter Registrar Office</a> </li></ul>
            <li>Request a printed application at the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/" class="link">Texas Secretary of State website</a>, and the Secretary of State’s Office will mail it to the address provided. Once received, simply fill it out and return to your local county election office. </li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/" class="link">Texas Secretary of State website</a>, print and fill out the Voter Registration Application, and mail the form (stamp needed) to your local Voter Registrar’s Office. </li></ul>
            Once a voter registration application is completed and signed, it must be returned to your local county election office at least 30 days before the election day.            <br>

         <h2 id="early_voting" style="color:#c75b12;font-family:Georgia,serif">How can I vote by mail in Texas?</h2>
         <!-- <p></p> -->
         <body>To be eligible to vote by mail in Texas, you must either be 65 years or older, have a disability or an illness, be confined in jail, or out of the county in which you’re registered on Election Day and during the entire early voting period.
<br><br>
            You’ll need to deliver a completed application for ballot by mail to your county elections office. They can be dropped off in person before the start of early voting on Oct. 13, or local election officials must receive mailed applications by Oct. 23.
            <br><br> 
            You can print out an application, request one from the Secretary of State’s office, or contact your local elections office.
