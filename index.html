	<ul>

            <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/" class="link">Texas Secretary of State website</a>, print and fill out the Voter Registration Application, and mail the form (stamp needed) to your local Voter Registrar’s Office. </li></ul>

         <h2 id="early_voting" style="color:#c75b12;font-family:Georgia,serif">How can I vote by mail in Texas?</h2>

<br><br>

         <h2 id="things_to_do" style="color:#c75b12;font-family:Georgia,serif">UTD County Division Reminder</h2>
         <!-- <p></p> -->
         <body>
            When registering to vote, figuring out where to vote, and educating yourself about the candidates on your ballot, keep in mind that a county division line runs east horizontally from Waterview Parkway to Rutford Avenue, splitting the UTD Campus between Collin and Dallas County.<br><br>
            Due to this, Canyon Creek and University Village Phases 1–3 fall in Dallas County’s Precinct 2500. University Commons residence halls, Northside, and University Village Phases 6–9, however, should vote in Collin County’s Precinct 55. Even more divided are Phases 4 and 5, which rest on the county line. 
            Therefore, residents’ registration depends not only in which building but also in which apartment they reside.
<br><br>
            <div class="tab">Collin County Includes:
	<ul>
            <li>Phase 4 (Except Buildings 33 & 39)</li>
            <li>Phase 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</li>
            <li>Building 38 North Apartments</li>
            <li>Residence Halls</li>
            <li>Northside</li>
	</ul>
            Dallas County Includes:
